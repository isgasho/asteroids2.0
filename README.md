# asteroids2.0
asteroids with procedural destruction and fog of war written in Rust

The code is the worst thing that ever existed. I wrote it during my "learning Rust/gamdev/graphics" times. Don't read it :)

To run the game
```
git clone git@github.com:pum-purum-pum-pum/asteroids2.0.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
