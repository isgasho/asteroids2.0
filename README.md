# Twenty asteroids
Asteroids with procedural destruction and fog of war written in Rust

![twenty asteroids](cover.png "This is a sample image.")

# Code
The code is the worst thing that ever existed and highly inspired by Terry Cavanagh VVVVVV... source or something. I wrote it during my "learning Rust/gamedev/graphics" times. Don't read it :) Linters? Haven't heard about that.
It will not compile without provided Cargo.lock :\ There are too many dependencies. Sorry I didn't know what I'm doing

To run the game
```
git clone git@github.com:pum-purum-pum-pum/asteroids2.0.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
