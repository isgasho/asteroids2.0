# Twenty asteroids
Asteroids with procedural destruction and fog of war written in Rust

![twenty asteroids](cover.png "Twenty asteroids")

# Code
The code is the worst thing that ever existed (How do you like it Terry Cavanagh?). 

I wrote it during my "learning Rust/gamedev/graphics" times. Don't read it :) I don't know why I haven't used linters at least... But I guess the moment is lost :)

It will not compile without provided Cargo.lock :\ 

Yes, there are too many dependencies.

To clone the repo
```
git clone git@github.com:pum-purum-pum-pum/asteroids2.0.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then with cargo (install if needed):
```
cargo run --release
```
And wait while it compiles
