* sample random skills \/
* when died, restart from menu
* skill menu via hotkey
* blaster add skills 
* * reflection (initial speed of each reflection is less than prev)
* * additional side bullets
* * damage
* * accuracy (reduce bullets spread)
*  Angnostic skills
* * ship speed
* * ship rotation speed
* * shield regen
* * hull regen
* * shield size
* * hull size


* add text



not ordered by priority
* add asteroids initial movement and rotation \/
* redo asteroids explosions: fix rotation of parts when destructed \/ (seems good but when rotation is fast feels wrong?)
* redo asteroids explosions: add lifes \/
* redo character asteroids collision?
* redo effects spawning (explosion when destroyed, mini explosion when shoted) \/
* enemies start shoot when theay near you and stop futher \/
* enemies should avoid asteroids \hacked, need something clever/
* wasd control \/
* try shadows again
* lazer weapon (rotation) \/
* lazer weapon (no rotation) not fit in controls X
* shotgun weapon \/
* boosts from asteroids
 <!-- * * ship speed boost for some time X -->
<!-- * * "additional weapon"  -- trace like in bitblaster -->
* once someone got shooted make it's sprite white for a second
* add screen shake (when just shooting to?)
* ship knockback?
* sleep when killed enemy???
* * money $$$ for buying ships and weapons
* * ?shield and hull repair
* weapon rotated bullets around you like in bitblaster
* enemies
* * rarely throws bullets around
* * constantly trhows slow bullets in spiral(while rotating)
* * rarely throws super fast bullets
* * lazer beam enemy
* * lazer beams around and rotating
* scores table
* try move camera according to gun direction
* asteroids damage?
* redo gui
* choose weapon and ship before start (it's saved from previous choise)
* add rotation bullets gun
* bullet trace like in nova drift looks awesome
* lazer sound
* ship sound
* animations
* explosions with animations
* add screen border markers to indicate enemies out of screen
* shotgun enemies
* * weapon modifier -- bullets reflection(for lazer it would be super cool too :D for shotgun it would be nice to add additional stike in place where reflected)


* more bass to sound lol :)
* random explosions
* camera back when shooting (instead of screenshake?)
* bigger explosions 
* slow motion when dead

TECH AND TEST:
* Android Joystick touch controls \/

GAMEPLAY
* collectables? (from killed enemies and asteroids probably)
* enemies
* ship upgrades?
* asteroids parts

MEDIA:
* stars like here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s52YZMoHur0  (change background color according to how near we are)
* screen shake with depth rotation so it looks like more 3d depth shake
* sound effects
* shadows intersection bug
* thrusters
* parallax background
* particles on movement
* camera distance based on speed
